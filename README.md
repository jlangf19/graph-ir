# Neo4j Incident Response Platform
The vision of this project is to design an incident response and security monitor tool processes data the way humans do: as a series of observations that are interconnected in time and space. This platform will emphasize the interconnection of artifacts across a client network to show the relationships between IOCs, validate compromise scope, and generate insights in an intuitive fashion.
